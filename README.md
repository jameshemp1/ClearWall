# ClearWall
This is a work in progress tool which I originally developed for my Capstone project during my final semester at Acadia University.

This app is a two-in-one Windows Firewall manager and network packet sniffer. 

The UI is quite barebones and a few areas of the backend like packet decoding need to be improved on.  

Built in the .NET framework and uses Windows Presentation Foundation framework for the UI.

Utilizes .NET packages:  
PacketDotNet  
Sharppcap  

Non-standard C# libraries:  
NetFwTypeLib
